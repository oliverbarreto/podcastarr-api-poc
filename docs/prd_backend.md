# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Product Name: YouTube Audio Downloader Backend

Version:1.0

# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Purpose

The YouTube Audio Downloader is an application designed to allow users to download the best-quality audio from YouTube videos. Users will provide a YouTube URL through a web-based interface, and the backend will process the request and make the audio file available for download.

## 1.2 Objectives

Provide a simple, intuitive interface for users to download YouTube audio.

Ensure high performance and reliability for processing downloads.

Offer publicly accessible storage for downloaded audio files.

## 1.3 Target Audience

Content creators who need audio tracks.

Casual users who want to download audio for offline use.

Individuals seeking audio-only versions of educational content or podcasts.

# 2. Features

## 2.1 Core Features

Frontend (Next.js 15):

Input field for users to paste YouTube URLs.

Button to initiate the download process.

Display of download progress and status (e.g., success or error).

List of previously downloaded files (publicly accessible).

Backend (Python, FastAPI):

Validate the provided YouTube URL.

Use the pytubefix library to download the best-quality audio.

Store the downloaded audio file in a local or cloud-based file system.

Provide APIs for:

Submitting a YouTube URL for processing.

Fetching the status of a download.

Listing publicly available files.

## 2.2 Public File Access

Make downloaded files accessible through a unique public URL.

Implement directory listing for browsing downloadable files.

## 2.3 Error Handling

Handle invalid URLs or unsupported formats gracefully.

Notify users of errors (e.g., video unavailable, network issues).

Log errors for backend troubleshooting.

## 2.4 Security

Rate limiting to prevent abuse.

Optional CAPTCHA for user verification.

Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks.

## 2.5 Performance

Use asynchronous processing for downloads to handle multiple requests simultaneously.

Optimize storage and retrieval of audio files for fast access.

## 2.6 Logging

Use the loguru library for logging.
This implementation:

- Creates a centralized logging configuration
- Logs to both console and file with different levels
- Includes rotation and retention policies for log files
- Adds structured logging with timestamps and module information
- Tracks all important events and errors
- Uses different log levels appropriately (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

The logs will be stored in the logs directory with daily rotation and 7-day retention. You'll see:

- All requests and their outcomes
- Download progress and completion
- Any errors that occur during processing
- File management operations
- Application startup and initialization

# 6. Risks and Mitigation

## 6.1 Legal Risks

Risk: Violating YouTube’s terms of service.

Mitigation: Include disclaimers and abide by copyright laws.

## 6.2 Technical Risks

Risk: High server load during concurrent downloads.

Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and asynchronous processing.

## 6.3 User Risks

Risk: Users providing invalid or malicious URLs.

Mitigation: Validate and sanitize user input.

# 7. Future Enhancements

Support for additional platforms beyond YouTube.

User accounts to track download history.

Notifications for download completion.

Cloud-based file storage for scalability.

# Why this architecture?

## Advantages of Next.js for the Frontend:

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR):

Next.js offers SSR, which can improve SEO and initial load performance for your app.
This is beneficial if you plan to index pages where users can publicly access files or interact with the app.

### API Routes:

Next.js can handle simple API endpoints directly, but in your case, having Python for more complex backend logic is more powerful.

### Modern Features:

With React under the hood, Next.js provides access to a robust ecosystem and modern UI development practices.
Features like app router in Next.js 15 simplify client-server interactions.

### Static and Dynamic Pages:

Next.js allows you to create both static and dynamic pages easily, which is useful for displaying publicly accessible files or user-specific data.

### Performance Optimizations:

Built-in optimizations, such as image handling and bundling, improve the app's performance.

## Advantages of Python for the Backend:

### Powerful Libraries:

Python has libraries like pytubefix for downloading YouTube videos and many others for tasks like file handling and database interactions.

### FastAPI:

Using FastAPI ensures you get a high-performance backend with automatic documentation and great developer experience.
It works well with asynchronous tasks, which are helpful for handling video/audio downloads.

### Asynchronous Capabilities:

Python allows for asynchronous handling, ideal for downloading large files without blocking other requests.

### Flexibility:

Python’s versatility lets you easily integrate databases, file storage systems, and other services.

## How They Complement Each Other:

### Separation of Concerns:

The backend focuses solely on handling API requests, business logic, and file processing, while the frontend handles the user interface.
This modular approach is clean and makes scaling easier.

### Communication:

The frontend can interact with the backend through RESTful APIs or even WebSocket connections for real-time updates (e.g., progress bars for downloads).

## Technology Interoperability:

Next.js (Node.js-based) and Python communicate seamlessly over HTTP/HTTPS APIs.

## Potential Challenges:

### Deployment:

Deploying two different stacks might require extra setup, like managing environments for Python (e.g., Docker) and Node.js.
Tools like Vercel (for Next.js) and AWS, Heroku, or Fly.io (for Python) can simplify deployment.

### Latency:

A small overhead may arise if frontend-backend communication occurs over the network, but it's negligible for most applications.

## When Is This Not Ideal?

If your app’s frontend is very simple and doesn’t need React features, you could consider Python frameworks like Flask or Django for both frontend and backend to simplify the stack.
For very high-performance apps, merging the frontend and backend to reduce network overhead might be better (though this sacrifices modularity).

## Conclusion:

The choice of Next.js for the frontend and Python for the backend is excellent for modularity, developer experience, and leveraging the strengths of both technologies.

If you're confident in managing the deployment and interactions between the two, it's a modern and scalable stack.
