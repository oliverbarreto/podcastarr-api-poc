## YT-DLP - EMBEDDING YT-DLP

yt-dlp makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language.

Your program should avoid parsing the normal stdout since they may change in future versions. Instead, they should use options such as -J, --print, --progress-template, --exec etc to create console output that you can reliably reproduce and parse.

From a Python program, you can embed yt-dlp in a more powerful fashion, like this:

```python
from yt_dlp import YoutubeDL

URLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']
with YoutubeDL() as ydl:
ydl.download(URLS)
```

Most likely, you'll want to use various options. For a list of options available, have a look at yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py or help(yt_dlp.YoutubeDL) in a Python shell. If you are already familiar with the CLI, you can use devscripts/cli_to_api.py to translate any CLI switches to YoutubeDL params.

> Tip: If you are porting your code from youtube-dl to yt-dlp, one important point to look out for is that we do not guarantee the return value of YoutubeDL.extract_info to be json serializable, or even be a dictionary. It will be dictionary-like, but if you want to ensure it is a serializable dictionary, pass it through YoutubeDL.sanitize_info as shown in the example below

### Embedding examples

#### Extracting information

```python
import json
import yt_dlp

URL = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'

# ℹ️ See help(yt_dlp.YoutubeDL) for a list of available options and public functions

ydl_opts = {}
with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
info = ydl.extract_info(URL, download=False)

    # ℹ️ ydl.sanitize_info makes the info json-serializable
    print(json.dumps(ydl.sanitize_info(info)))
```

#### Download using an info-json

```python
import yt_dlp

INFO_FILE = 'path/to/video.info.json'

with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL() as ydl:
error_code = ydl.download_with_info_file(INFO_FILE)

print('Some videos failed to download' if error_code
else 'All videos successfully downloaded')
```

#### Extract audio

```python
import yt_dlp

URLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']

ydl_opts = {
'format': 'm4a/bestaudio/best', # ℹ️ See help(yt_dlp.postprocessor) for a list of available Postprocessors and their arguments
'postprocessors': [{ # Extract audio using ffmpeg
'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
'preferredcodec': 'm4a',
}]
}

with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
error_code = ydl.download(URLS)
```

#### Filter videos

```python
import yt_dlp

URLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']

def longer_than_a_minute(info, \*, incomplete):
"""Download only videos longer than a minute (or with unknown duration)"""
duration = info.get('duration')
if duration and duration < 60:
return 'The video is too short'

ydl_opts = {
'match_filter': longer_than_a_minute,
}

with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
error_code = ydl.download(URLS)
```

#### Adding logger and progress hook

```python
import yt_dlp

URLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']

class MyLogger:
def debug(self, msg): # For compatibility with youtube-dl, both debug and info are passed into debug # You can distinguish them by the prefix '[debug] '
if msg.startswith('[debug] '):
pass
else:
self.info(msg)

    def info(self, msg):
        pass

    def warning(self, msg):
        pass

    def error(self, msg):
        print(msg)
```

```python
def my_hook(d):

def my_hook(d):
if d['status'] == 'finished':
print('Done downloading, now post-processing ...')

ydl_opts = {
'logger': MyLogger(),
'progress_hooks': [my_hook],
}

with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
ydl.download(URLS)
```

#### Add a custom PostProcessor

```python
import yt_dlp

URLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']

# ℹ️ See help(yt_dlp.postprocessor.PostProcessor)

class MyCustomPP(yt_dlp.postprocessor.PostProcessor):
def run(self, info):
self.to_screen('Doing stuff')
return [], info

with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL() as ydl: # ℹ️ "when" can take any value in yt_dlp.utils.POSTPROCESS_WHEN
ydl.add_post_processor(MyCustomPP(), when='pre_process')
ydl.download(URLS)
```

#### Use a custom format selector

```python
import yt_dlp

URLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']

def format_selector(ctx):
""" Select the best video and the best audio that won't result in an mkv.
NOTE: This is just an example and does not handle all cases """

    # formats are already sorted worst to best
    formats = ctx.get('formats')[::-1]

    # acodec='none' means there is no audio
    best_video = next(f for f in formats
                      if f['vcodec'] != 'none' and f['acodec'] == 'none')

    # find compatible audio extension
    audio_ext = {'mp4': 'm4a', 'webm': 'webm'}[best_video['ext']]
    # vcodec='none' means there is no video
    best_audio = next(f for f in formats if (
        f['acodec'] != 'none' and f['vcodec'] == 'none' and f['ext'] == audio_ext))

    # These are the minimum required fields for a merged format
    yield {
        'format_id': f'{best_video["format_id"]}+{best_audio["format_id"]}',
        'ext': best_video['ext'],
        'requested_formats': [best_video, best_audio],
        # Must be + separated list of protocols
        'protocol': f'{best_video["protocol"]}+{best_audio["protocol"]}'
    }

ydl_opts = {
'format': format_selector,
}

with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
ydl.download(URLS)
```

Final Words.

1. What is yt-dlp?

YT-DLP is a free and open-source software project created (as a fork) from the now-discontinued project, youtube-dlc. yt-dlp is based on the popular YouTube downloader, youtube-dlc, but now comes with additional features and improvements. This software is basically used to download videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and other similar websites.

Downloading and installing yt-dlp is relatively easy, but learning how to use it properly, can take some time. YT-DLP is a command-line tool used on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Having no “beautiful” front-end GUI puts many people off, yet it is the most potent youtube downloader available.

What are YT-DLP’s main features?
Network Options: Change how yt-dlp communicates with the network. This includes options such as setting a proxy, adjusting the timeout value, and specifying the user agent string.
Bypass Geo Restriction: This feature allows you to bypass geographical restrictions that may prevent you from accessing specific videos based on location. You can use yt-dlp options with a VPN or a proxy to get around these restrictions.
Video Selection: With yt-dlp, you can select the videos you want to download from a playlist or channel. In addition, you can also download entire playlists and channels.
Download Options: This feature allows you to control the downloading process. You can, for example, choose to download only audio, only video, or both. You can also set the video quality and download speed limits.
Filesystem Options: With this feature, you can specify the output directory and filename templates for downloaded videos.
Thumbnail Images: Download thumbnail images for videos along with the video itself. You can even specify the image format and size.
Workarounds: This feature provides various workarounds for issues arising during the download process. For example, you can use the –no-check-certificate option to bypass SSL certificate verification.
Automatic retries for failed downloads. By default, yt-dlp will make three attempts to download a video before giving up and moving on to the next one. You can also configure this number of retries.
Video Format Options: Yt-dlp lets you choose the video format you want to download, such as MP4, WebM, or FLV. You can also set the video quality and resolution.
Subtitle Features: This yt-dlp option allows you to download subtitles (embed them) along with the video. You can specify the subtitle format and language.
Authentication Options: Authenticate with certain websites, such as YouTube or Vimeo. You can use options such as username and password or API key to authenticate.
Post-processing Options: Perform various post-processing tasks on downloaded videos, such as merging or splitting video files, adding metadata, or converting the video to a different format.
Integrates with SponsorBlock: This feature enables you to mark/remove sponsor sections in YouTube videos through the SponsorBlock API. 2. How to download and install YT-DLP?
Go to yt-dlp official GitHub repository: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
Scroll down to the bottom of the page, where the download button is visible. This internal (anchor) link will take you to: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation.

a. Downloading and Installing yt-dlp on Windows.
For illustration purposes, we will download and run yt-dlp.exe for a Windows 2022 Server.
Once downloaded, verify the size, version, and company. Take a look at the screenshot below.
downloading and installing Yt-dlp
Note: The yt-dlp.exe file is not an installer; it’s the executable file for yt-dlp itself. In the context of Windows, an executable file (with an .exe extension) is a program that can run directly once it’s clicked or executed from the command line. For yt-dlp, you simply place the yt-dlp.exe file in a directory of your choice (for instance C:\ytdlp) and run it directly from there.

b. Downloading and Installing yt-dlp in Linux (Ubuntu).
For illustration purposes, we will download and install the latest release of yt-dlp in Ubuntu 22.04. Ensure your Ubuntu machine is up to date.
The following command downloads the latest release of the yt-dlp program from GitHub and installs it in the /usr/local/bin directory with the filename yt-dlp.
$ sudo wget https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -O /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
1
$ sudo wget https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -O /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
downloading and installing Yt-dlp
The following command sets the permissions of the yt-dlp file in the /usr/local/bin directory to allow all users (owner, group, and others) to read and execute the file.
$ sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
1
$ sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
This command is necessary to allow users to run the yt-dlp command from the command line.
downloading and installing Yt-dlp 3. Installing Dependencies: FFmpeg and FFProbe
Before moving on with yt-dlp, it is highly recommended that you install FFmpeg and FFprobe. There are other ‘optional’ dependencies regarding the network, metadata, and miscellaneous, but FFmpeg and FFProbe are almost “mandatory”

FFmpeg is a multimedia framework for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files. It is used by yt-dlp to perform various multimedia operations, including merging different formats of video or audio files. Without it, yt-dlp won’t be able to merge requested formats. For instance, you may download a 1080p video without audio.
FFProbe is the command-line tool that comes with FFmpeg. FFProbe is used to analyze and extract information from multimedia files such as video and audio. Yt-dlp needs to use FFProbe to extract metadata from the multimedia files being downloaded. This metadata includes information such as the video or audio codec, the resolution, the duration, the bit rate, and other technical details about the multimedia file. Without FFprobe, yt-dlp would not be able to extract this metadata, and some of its features may not work correctly.

Before installing FFmpeg and FFProbe, ensure that your machine is up to date.
a. Installing FFmpeg and FFprobe on Linux.
To install FFmpeg on a Linux machine (Ubuntu 22.04), use the following command:

$ sudo apt install ffmpeg
1
$ sudo apt install ffmpeg
To check the installation and current version, use the following command:
$ ffmpeg -version
1
$ ffmpeg -version
downloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies
FFprobe installation? FFprobe comes when you install the FFmpeg package. There is no need to do additional installation for FFprobe. To test whether FFprobe is installed, issue the “ffprobe” command:

downloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies
b. Installing FFmpeg and FFprobe on Windows
Go to https://ffmpeg.org/ and download the package (.EXE file) for Windows. Release builds are usually more stable than Git Master build, which are released more often
Choose your release, download the 7z or zip file and uncrompress it.
downloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies
Photo by Github
Download the package and save it anywhere you want.
We created a new folder called “PATH_Programs-ytdpl” where we will move and unzip the FFmpeg package.
Under ffmpeg-(name of the file) > bin > you’ll see the three tools: ffmpeg, ffplay, and ffprobe. Move (unzip) the three applications to your new folder.
downloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies
Record the path (for example: C:\PATH_Programs -ytdlp) and head over to “Edit the system environment variables.” This Windows utility allows you to modify the environment variables that are used by the operating system and applications running on your computer. The PATH environment variable we will define next specifies a list of directories that the operating system should search when looking for executable files.
To open this, go to the search bar on Windows and type “path”
downloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies
In System Properties > Advanced, head over to “Environment Variables”
downloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies
In Environment Variables, under “User variables for Administrators” choose Path (1) > then click on “Edit”.
downloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies
The new “Edit Enviromnet variable” window will open. Click on New (1) > Enter the Path where FFmpeg is stored (2) > Click on Ok (3).
downloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies
Now, whenever you want to run FFmpeg from any folder or location, the computer will know where it is and allow you to use it.
Now, test the FFmpeg configuration from the Windows command prompt. Open the “cmd” and type ‘ffmpeg’. You should get an output such as the one below.
downloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies
FFprobe comes with the FFmpeg installation (as you might have noticed above). To test FFprove, do the same as ffmpeg. Simply go to the command prompt and type ‘ffprobe’.

As you might already know, yt-dlp is a command-line tool, so to use it (in Windows or Linux), you will have to go through the command prompt or terminal. If you have already downloaded, and installed it along with its dependencies, go ahead and open your terminal.

Disclaimer: Downloading videos from YouTube using tools like yt-dlp may potentially infringe upon the terms of service, copyrights, and intellectual property rights of content creators. It is important to recognize and comply with the applicable laws and regulations regarding the downloading and distribution of copyrighted material in your jurisdiction. This note does not constitute legal advice and should not be relied upon as such.

a. How to use yt-dlp in Windows?
Yt-dlp runs on the command line (it has no frontend GUI). When you run it from the cmd.exe for the first time (without any arguments), you will notice an error message (such as the following): “yt-dlp.exe: error: You must provide at least one URL”
using Yt-dlp
Let’s go ahead and access the help menu. To see a list of all the options, use type the “yt-dlp –help” command. A menu such as the following will appear in your terminal (or command prompt):
using Yt-dlp
To use yt-dlp, ensure you are in the same location where yt-dlp.exe is, and use it with “yt-dlp (following the youtube URL), for instance:
yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM
1
yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM
using Yt-dlp
Yt-dlp allows you to use arguments to empower you with more options when downloading your youtube videos.
For example, you can tell yt-dlp exactly the format you want and how to download it. To do this, you might have to first find out what formats are available: Use the following command:
yt-dlp -F --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM
1
yt-dlp -F --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM
using Yt-dlp
Now, you might want to download a youtube video (i.e.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM) with the format (-f) best quality video and best audio available (with specific format); to do this use the following command:
yt-dlp -f “bestvideo&#91;ext=mp4]+bestaudio&#91;ext=m4a]” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM

1
2
yt-dlp -f “bestvideo&#91;ext=mp4]+bestaudio&#91;ext=m4a]” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM

using Yt-dlp
To learn more about these arguments and how to use them properly, use the yt-dlp –help” command.
And that’s it; we downloaded two youtube videos using yt-dlp.
using Yt-dlp
b. yt-dlp commands for Linux
Same as Windows, in Ubuntu Linux, if you type yt-dlp [without arguments] in the terminal console, you’ll get an error message.
using Yt-dlp
If need to see the yt-dlp help menu, use the following command yt-dlp –help
If you want to download a youtube video with the best quality video and best audio available, use the following command:
yt-dlp -f 'bv*+ba' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM
1
yt-dlp -f 'bv*+ba' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM
using Yt-dlp
Note: If you see the following WARNING message: “You have requested merging of multiple formats (of video and audio), but FFmpeg is not installed. The formats won’t be merged.” it means that you have not yet installed FFmpeg… To learn how to install FFmpeg, go back to the section (installing FFmpeg).

Now, what if you want to download a specific format for your youtube video? A useful Format command is the “-F –list-formats.” For example, we would like to list the available formats on the video >
yt-dlp -F --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM
1
yt-dlp -F --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM
using Yt-dlp
For example, from the above output, you can see that this youtube video is available for download with video and audio at the resolutions 144p, 360p, and 720p. Now, let’s specify which format we want to download.
We will use another video as an example. First (as shown before) see the available formats and then use the command “-f ‘bv*[height=…]+ba’” to specify the format. For instance,
yt-dlp -F --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jw9W7kUBFk
1
yt-dlp -F --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jw9W7kUBFk
yt-dlp -f 'bv*&#91;height=720]+ba' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jw9W7kUBFk
1
yt-dlp -f 'bv\*&#91;height=720]+ba' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jw9W7kUBFk
using Yt-dlp
Using the above set of commands will help you be more specific about which youtube video format you would want to download. Instead of downloading the highest (4K, for example), you can specify the audio and video format.
In addition, you’ll notice that the FFmpeg WARNING message is not showing. This is because at this point, we already have installed FFmpeg correctly. 5. Advanced uses for Plugin yt-dlp.
Below we will show you two more advanced uses for the yt-dlp plugin. We will show you these examples on Linux.

a. Configuring the yt-dlp.conf file.
The plugin yt-dlp also offers the option to establish a range of defaults that it will automatically implement, including a preferred video format such as mkv, mp4, webm, etc. To create a configuration file that yt-dlp can use, enter supported commands into the configuration file. The config file can be loaded from the system (/etc/yt-dlp.conf), user configuration, home configuration, portable or main configuration.

Open (or create) the yt-dlp.conf from your terminal using the text editor:
sudo vim /etc/yt-dlp.conf
1
sudo vim /etc/yt-dlp.conf
Or
sudo vi /etc/yt-dlp.conf
1
sudo vi /etc/yt-dlp.conf
The below configuration file is an example (but you can customize it to your own preferences). Using the below configuration, yt-dlp will automatically save all videos in a particular path (/Youtube) and renames them to the Title.extension. By default, yt-dlp saves youtube videos to its default path and gives the URL as the main title.
The configuration will also embed a thumbnail, metadata, and English subtitles.

using Yt-dlp
Now let’s try our brand new yt-dlp configuration:
yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8HY1aVzZDM
1
yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8HY1aVzZDM
using Yt-dlp
With this configuration file, you can automate your entire youtube download process. This saves you time, as you no longer have to enter configuration for each line of video download. The configuration file will use your personalized download format for the process.

Note (For Windows users): It is recommended to put this config file in “${APPDATA}/yt-dlp/config” and save it as .txt. The AppData folder is under “C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\” and is usually a hidden folder. Setting configuration lines in this config file is similar to what we did with Linux in this section.

b. Use Bashrc files.
Another way you can optimize your download process with yt-dlp is to use bashrc files. These files contain shell (command-line interface) settings for the Bash shell. The bashrc file is executed every time a new terminal session is opened, and it can be used to configure various settings and aliases for the shell. The bashrc file can be very useful for yt-dlp, because you can use it to set up aliases or shell functions that simplify the usage of yt-dlp. For example, you can create an alias that automatically downloads a video in your preferred format and quality by typing a single command in the terminal. This can save you time and make it easier to use yt-dlp regularly.

To locate the .bashrc (in Ubuntu) go to home/ubunu > .bashrc
using Yt-dlp
Open the .bashrc with any of the following text editors.
sudo vi ~/.bashrc
1
sudo vi ~/.bashrc
Or,

sudo nano ~/.bashrc
1
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
Enter the bashrc aliases for yt-dlp that you would like. For example:

# yt-dlp aliases

alias ydl='yt-dlp'
alias ydlmp4='yt-dlp -f "bestvideo&#91;ext=mp4]+bestaudio&#91;ext=m4a]/best&#91;ext=mp4]/best"'
alias ydlmkv='yt-dlp -f "bestvideo&#91;ext=mkv]+bestaudio&#91;ext=mka]/best&#91;ext=mkv]/best"'
1
2
3
4

# yt-dlp aliases

alias ydl='yt-dlp'
alias ydlmp4='yt-dlp -f "bestvideo&#91;ext=mp4]+bestaudio&#91;ext=m4a]/best&#91;ext=mp4]/best"'
alias ydlmkv='yt-dlp -f "bestvideo&#91;ext=mkv]+bestaudio&#91;ext=mka]/best&#91;ext=mkv]/best"'
using Yt-dlp
To activate the aliases, either close and reopen the terminal window or run the following command:
$ source ~/.bashrc
1
$ source ~/.bashrc
Now, let’s test our alias. This should make our lives easier when downloading youtube videos with yt-dlp. Use an alias; for example, by entering “ydlmp4” you are saving yourself on writing long commands such as bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best
There are many things happening now! As you can see from the below output… Our alias is working, the configuration is trying to embed thumbnails, subtitles, metadata, etc. Plus, the video is being saved in (and with) /Youtube/%(title)s.%(ext)s – where the title is the name of the video rather than the URL.
using Yt-dlp
c. Manage and download large amounts of data with yt-dlp into a seedbox.
If you download and manage large amounts of data with yt-dlp, then a seedbox can be a fantastic solution. A seedbox is a remote VPS or dedicated server designed for anonymous download and upload of digital files, such as torrents, NZBs, videos, and music. Plus, since seedboxes are designed for downloading and uploading, they usually offer high speeds.

For instance, you can remotely connect to your seedbox and use its powerful resources to download videos with yt-dlp. Seedboxes also offer streaming platforms like Plex or Kodi and other wonderful ways to manage your media collection. Plus, if you decide later to change the format, compress, or encode, seedboxes also come with robust media converters like Handbrake. You can later download all your media content easily with FTP or Sync protocols.

This combination allows fast and efficient downloads and easy management of all your downloaded content.

6. yt-dlp: Pros and Cons
   Although yt-dlp has many great features and characteristics that make it one of the best youtube downloaders, it also has a few disadvantages that you should know about. Here are some pros and cons of using yt-dlp.

a. Pros:
Free and open-source: yt-dlp is 100% free. It is also an open-source project maintained by a solid community of developers.
Multi-platform support: yt-dlp is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. This multi-platform support makes it accessible to a wide range of users.
Variety of download options: Although yt-dlp is one of the best for what it does, “download youtube videos,” it also has additional options that are hard to see in other video downloaders. These download options include video format, subtitle selection, and thumbnail images.
Automatic retries: yt-dlp has some fantastic automation capabilities. One of the best features it that it can automatically retry failed downloads, saving you time and effort.
Support for more sites and extensions: yt-dlp supports more sites other than youtube, including Vimeo and Youku. It also supports browser extensions like SponsorBlock, to allow you to skip sponsored segments in YouTube videos.
Cons:
No GUI: One turndown for many people when using yt-dlp is the lack of GUI. yt-dlp is a command-line tool, which may not be ideal for users who prefer a graphical user interface.
Configuration required: As you might have noticed from our step-by-step guide to configure and use yt-dlp, the tool requires some knowledge for its configuration. To use yt-dlp, you must learn the configuration lines to get the desired output format, audio quality, or other options.
